=head1 NAME

Mail::XML - Adds a toXML() method to Mail::Internet.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mail::XML;  
  my $mi = new Mail::XML(\@message);
  print $mi->toXML();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All that this module does is provide a toXML() method to Mail::Internet.  For all intents and
purposes, Mail::XML is Mail::Internet plus toXML(), so you are best off reading the Mail::Internet
manpage :)
 
=head1 WHY??

I had some messy scripts which took messages from a mailing list and archived them in XML.  When it
came time to maintain my messy scripts, I was lost, so I started using Mail::Internet and just supplying
my own toXML() method.  This module is an evolution of all of that :)

=head1 FUTURE PLANS

I plan on doing something useful with MIME attachments, supplying a toMIME() function.  Ideas and
contributions are welcome.
